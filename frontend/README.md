# Data Platform Frontend

This project uses [VueJS 3](https://vuejs.org/) with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
For form validation [Vuelidate](https://vuelidate-next.netlify.app/) is used.

VITE_ROOT_API is the URL for the backend API, either on localhost or in the cloud.
